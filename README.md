## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

### I ensure that my code, program, or softare is functional and secure by combinging requirement-driven testing by writing unit test from the requirements/acceptance criteria and edge cases.  I will add regression testing for every defect found which prevents repeat defects and ensures feature development. In regards to security, I validate and sanitize all inputs at the constructor or setters and service methods relaying on immutable IDs. 


## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

### I translate the users needs into clear artificates and executeable checks from the requirements / acceptance critera that was supplied. Breaking down each requirement into unit test. 

## How do I approach designing software?

### The best way to approach designing softare is by starting with the business goals and user needs, then moving to a high-level architecture then finally detailing the component design using modular principles. Ensuring that I understand the problem, then working through the user experience, while planning the overall struture with scalability and flexibility.
